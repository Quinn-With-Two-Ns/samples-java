## Message passing samples


**Note that the single file format is used for sample brevity and is not something we recommend for real applications.**

To run each message passing sample, use one of the following commands:

```bash
./gradlew -q execute -PmainClass=io.temporal.samples.messagepassing.introduction.MessagePassingIntro
```
